# Inheritance Problem

An interesting math problem posed by a colleague. The repo contains a solution in a Jupyter notebook. The solution can be viewed at [GitHub Pages](https://davidjcastner.github.io/inheritance-problem/) or a pdf version can be downloaded [here](./inheriteance_problem.pdf).

**Original problem:**

A farmer passed away. In the farmer's will, they passed their 17 horses to 3 heirs. The first heir was assigned 1/2 of the horses, the second heir was assigned 1/3 of the horses, and the third heir was assigned 1/9 of the horses. When the heirs struggled to evenly divide the horses, the farmer's neighbor offered to add one of their own horses to the team of 17 (for a total of 18). Then the first heir took 9 horses (1/2 of 18), the second heir took 6 horses (1/3 of 18), and the third heir took 2 horses (1/9 of 18). Finally, the neighbor took the remaining horse, and everyone lived happily ever after.

What numbers can be applied to this story?
